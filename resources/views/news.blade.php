                                "This assistance is distributed to relieve students who are experiencing difficulties in meeting daily basic needs due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak," said Head of the Jamik Unsyiah Mosque Charity House, Heru Fahlevi in ​​Darussalam, Banda Aceh, Wednesday.

                                He explained that the assistance was targeted at 200 students, with the initial stage, donations having been distributed on March 28, 2020 to dormitory residents and international students."We are working with the Unsyiah Dormitory manager.
                                They coordinate students and cook ready meals three times a day. Then the food is wrapped and delivered to each room. This is our way to maintain large-scale social restrictions," said Heru.He added that the funds collected at this time were donations from the Acehnese people and the Unsyiah academic community.He said that because the funds collected were still small, donations still prioritized students who were in urgency and met the criteria for assistance.

Zainudin Amali, SE., M.Si expressed his wish for Aceh to be included in the grand design of the national sport. He conveyed this in a public lecture at Syiah Kuala University (USK) with the theme 'National Sports Development' at the AAC Dayan Dawood Building. (Banda Aceh, 24/2/2022)
                            <p>
                                "Aceh must be included in the grand design of national sports, I hope it grows from USK," said Zainuddin Amali.
                                So far, Aceh has not been included in the grand design of the national sport, because it is considered that there are still many things that must be fulfilled. So far, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has determined the center points of national sports development in several regions.
                                Zainuddin Amali views that sport is actually important for the nation, in order to make Indonesia and the region proud in the eyes of the world.

                            <p>There are only two occasions when the flag and the national anthem are turned on, the president's visit and there are sports achievements. Those are two activities that made us famous," said the Minister of Youth and Sports. Therefore, he invited all parties to be diligent in exercising. Not everything has to be in sports
                                achievements or going to the gym, just wanting to move also counts as sports.
                            <p>However, a bright mind cannot be separated from a healthy body. The Minister of Youth and Sports also invites all parties to change the mindset, seeing that sport is not a fad or a side activity.
                            <P>So far, he says, no parent has ever asked, are you an athlete? On average, when their child is
                               proposed, what is the job.

In addition, several lecturers and education staff were also found to have been exposed to Covid-19 in the last two weeks," said USK Banda Aceh Public Relations Coordinator, Ferizal Hasan. Banda Aceh has decided to extend the online lecture period again until March 5, 2022. Previously, based on the development of Covid-19
                                cases in the campus environment, USK had implemented online lecture activities until February 20, 2022.

                                Lecturers with comorbid diseases were asked not to be assigned to offline classes. Then, practicum/skill lab/laboratory research/similar activities can be carried out offline in a capacity of only 50 percent. "All student activities outside the campus are also not allowed, if they are carried out online," said Ferizal. Not only that, said Ferizal, in order to increase immunity
                                and minimize the impact of exposure to Covid-19, the entire academic community, education staff and Students are required to carry out
                                a booster dose of vaccination. Evidence of booster vaccine injections must be uploaded to the USK staffing information system for lecturers and education staff.
